<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>kay, downfall may be a little dramatic, but if Disney continues at the rate it's going, I may not be far off. I used to be obsessed with the MCU. I loved watching all the theory videos and was so excited every time a new movie was announced, but when, epic though it was, Endgame managed to kill off or fatally change many of my favorite characters, I knew the MCU would never be the same. Around the same time in 2019 and 2020 Disney's live-action remakes churned out some interesting choices with a not-at-all-live-action "live action" Lion King including ["Can You Feel the Love Tonight"](https://youtu.be/DZr-VTULYQ8?si=H3eaDo2D2kChAh_x) being sung in the middle of the day and Mulan's fighting spirit being replaced with [magical](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4566758/reviews/) [chi](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/ily73g/you_dont_just_have_power_you_have_chi_power_or/?rdt=65373) [superpowers](https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/9/3/21419876/mulan-review-live-action-disney-plus), in other words completely missing the points of some of the old stories. Don't get me wrong, the animations are beautiful and the stories were still enjoyable, but I started sensing a pattern when looking back on those memories, and it got me wondering...</p>
