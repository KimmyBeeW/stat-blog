<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>kay, downfall may be a little dramatic, but if Disney continues at the rate it's going, I may not be far off. I used to be obsessed with the MCU. I loved watching all the theory videos on YouTube and was so excited every time a new movie was announced, but when, epic though it was, Endgame managed to kill off or fatally change many of my favorite characters, I knew the MCU would never be the same. Around the same time in 2019 and 2020 Disney's live-action remakes churned out some interesting choices with a not-at-all-live-action "live action" Lion King including ["Can You Feel the Love Tonight"](https://youtu.be/DZr-VTULYQ8?si=H3eaDo2D2kChAh_x) being sung in the middle of the day and the titular character of Mulan's fighting spirit being replaced with [magical](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4566758/reviews/) [chi](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/ily73g/you_dont_just_have_power_you_have_chi_power_or/?rdt=65373) [superpowers](https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/9/3/21419876/mulan-review-live-action-disney-plus), in other words completely missing the points of some of the old stories. The animations are still beautiful and the stories are still enjoyable, but I started sensing a pattern when looking back on those memories, and it got me wondering if those changes, and the apparent emphasis on quantity over quality, was starting to hurt Disney as a business. So I took my newfound web-scraping skills to the [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) website to see what the movie theater goers votes had to say.</p>

### How has Disney been doing as a company over the last few years?
Since Disney does more than just movies, I figured we should take a look first on how the shareholders view Disney's success in terms of what they're willing to pay for it in stocks. I got this stock data from [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/history/?period1=1571423893&period2=1729276688), and you can see that other than the obvious dip caused by the pandemic in March of 2020, Disney was on the rise until around February 2021, then fell again November of 2021, and hasn't gone above $130 since the beginning of 2022.

Because of the rise of inflation and the noteriaty of the company, Disney is still doing better than pre-2014. Loyal fans are still clinging on to the nostalgia of the past and the merch of the present, and there is no doubt that Disney is still a successful company, it is just an interesting thing to note before diving into the success of current movies.

### A tale as old as Box Office numbers
Now that we have an overview of what the shareholders think, let's look at what actual movie-goers think by how they voted with their ticket purchases. [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/brand/?ref_=bo_nb_gs_secondarytab) has a really awesome collection of brands, their respective movies, and info about those movies' lifetime gross income to date, max number of theaters, opening weekend gross income, opening number of theaters, release date, and distributer. It's really fun to look through their website, but I really wanted an aggregate of brands
